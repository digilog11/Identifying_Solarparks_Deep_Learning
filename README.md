# Identifying_Solarparks_Deep_Learning

This code was delevoped for a study project with the goal of identifying larger solarparks using machine learning. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with training data taken from Sentinel-2-Images and got a pixel-by-pixel classification as the result.
